# Learning-Python
My entire story of how i learnt python
All the stuff I made or make in this journey will be present in Try/Day X/Code
I won't look into issues, this basically a diary, so have fun

## Log 1/Day 1
After alot of procastination, i decided it is finally time to actually learn something, so here it goes, I learnt basic variable definition and ofc print
The code of what i made is present in Try/Day1/Code, everything will remain in the try folder till i reach Day 14, afterwards it will move to Logs, stuff that will become true programs will be in StuffThatWorked/NameOfIt/code
